This repository presents an IoT-based smart win-curtain system designed to intelligently control window curtains and indoor lighting using fuzzy logic and low-power wireless communication. The system aims to improve daylight utilization, indoor comfort, and energy efficiency in smart home environments.
The proposed architecture integrates multiple environmental sensors to monitor ambient light intensity, occupancy, temperature, and indoor air quality. A fuzzy logic–based control strategy is used to handle uncertainty in sensor data and generate smooth, adaptive control actions for curtain positioning and artificial lighting levels. Communication between embedded controller nodes and a central coordinator is implemented using ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4), enabling reliable and energy-aware data exchange.
This repository includes Arduino-based controller code, Raspberry Pi coordination scripts, and experimental support files, released to promote reproducibility and further research in IoT-enabled smart home automation.
